## REDIRECTION

Output redirection:
The o/p of a program is saved in another file using  >              operator

Input redirection:
We can read data from a file and give it to another file             using < operator

to append :
use >>

## PIPING :

The output from the program on the left is fed as input to the program on the right using the operator |

## FILTERS :

A filter is a program that accepts textual data and then transforms it in a particular way. They take raw data, either produced by another program, or stored in a file, and manipulate it to be displayed in a more suitable way.

## FILTER COMMANDS

head		//view the first n lines of data
tail		//view the last n lines of data.
sort		//organise the data into order.
nl		//print line numbers before data.
wc		//print a count of lines, words and characters.

## JOB CONTROL

A job is defined as a task or command that has started running but not yet finished what it is doing.

jobs 		// List all the jobs that are running or suspended.
fg 		// Bring the job to the foreground.
bg 		//Send the job to the background.
stop or Ctrl + z // Suspend the job.
kill or Ctrl + c // Terminate the job.

## FILE PERMISSION


The chmod command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory

## FILE OWNERSHIP

To change the owner of a file we can use the chown command

## FILE LINKS

A link is a connection between a file name and the actual data on the disk,ie we can have access to file using multiple names by creating a link.

Two types of links
    symbolic links: Refer to a symbolic path indicating the abstract location of another file
    hard links : Refer to the specific location of physical data

commands:

ln <filname> <link name>		//for hard link
ln -s <filname> <link name> 		//for symbolic link

## File System Hierarchy Standard Organisation

The /boot/ directory
Contains static files required to boot the system.
The /dev/ directory
Contains file system entries which represent devices that are attached to the system. These files are essential for the system to function properly.
The /etc/ directory
Reserved for configuration files that are local to the machine.
The X11/ and skel/ are subdirectories of this directory.
The /lib/ directory
Contain only those libraries needed to execute the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.
These shared library images are important for booting the system and executing the commands within the root file system.
The /mnt/ directory
This directory is for temporarily mounted file systems, such as CD-ROMs 
The /opt/ directory
Provides storage for large, static application software packages.
The /proc/ directory
Contains special files that either extract information from or send information to the kernel
This directory can be used to communicate with the kernel
The /sbin/ directory
Stores executables used by the root user, which are only used at boot time and perform system recovery operations. 
The /usr/ directory
This directory is for files that can be shared across mulltiple machines.It is read only.Often on its own paritition.
There are many subdirectories like |- bin/ ,|-doc/ ,|-tmp â†’/var/tmp 
The /usr/local directory
It is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. 
It have many subdirectories like |-bin/ ,|-doc/ ,|-games/ etc similar to  /usr/ directory.
The /var/ directory
Any program that write log files or need spool/ or /lock  should write them to /var/ directory.
/var/ is for variable data files. 
The are many subdirectories found within this directory
 /var
      |- accout/
      |- arpwatch/
      +- spool/
                         |- at/
                         |- news/
      |- tmp/
